// !!! WIP !!!
//
// THIS IS A BLANK FILE STANDING IN FOR libpact_mock_server.a
//
// Due to the way SPM works, specifically when running in CLI, binaries must be
// linked into the project as a package dependency.
// This file is only used for proper linking.
// Since libpact_mock_server.a is a huge file to be shared and we want to
// avoid GitHub-LFS, this is a dud file and the PactSwift (or your project) needs
// to build libpact_mock_server.a from a `PactSwift/submodules/pact-reference` at
// when building your project.
